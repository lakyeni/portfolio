      <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! <br> I'm Enikő, a passionate full-stack developer student. I enjoy
        creating web applications and learning new technologies. This portfolio
        showcases some of my projects and skills. I started this journey in 2025
        and have been continuously improving my skills. I'm still a beginner, as
        can be seen in my projects, but I learn quickly, as seen in my recent
        uploads. I'm excited to share my work with you! Technology has always
        fascinated me. I've been interested in computers for a long time because
        there are so many different aspects I find intriguing, from hardware to
        software. However, I wasn't sure which area I'd be good at. At my
        workplace, I was tasked with maintaining the company website even though
        I had no formal qualifications — just 20 years less experience than my
        colleagues! :D That's when I stumbled into web development, and since we
        used WordPress, I didn't necessarily need to learn programming
        languages. Instead, I was working with ready-made templates and
        maintaining the site's content. In November 2025, I started a Udemy
        course on full-stack development, which I completed by January 2026,
        covering HTML and CSS. In January 2026, I began the Prooktatás Full
        Stack Developer course, and I'm excited to dive into JavaScript and
        everything else that comes with it.
